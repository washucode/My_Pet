    <li>A dog’s whiskers help him “see” in the dark.Okay, it’s not quite night-vision or a super power, but those whiskers pick up on even subtle changes in air currents, providing your pup with information about the size, shape, and speed of things nearby. This allows your dog to better sense approaching dangers or prey — even at night.</li>
    <li>Dogs only have sweat glands in their paws.More specifically, they are found between their paw pads. That’s why it can help to wet the bottom of their feet on a hot day, and it’s also why dogs rely on panting as a means of cooling down.</li>
    <li> A one year-old pup is as physically mature as a 15-year-old human.Of course, different breeds age a little differently. Large dogs age faster than small ones.</li>

    <li>A dog is as smart as a 2-year-old toddler.There’s a reason a dog and toddlers get along so well: they speak the same language. </li>
    <li> A cat’s brain is biologically more similar to a human brain than it is to a dog’s. Both humans and cats have identical regions in their brains that are responsible for emotions.</li>
